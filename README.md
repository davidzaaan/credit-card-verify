# Credit Card validator
## Hi!

Credit cards are a important tool in our day-by-day life aren't they? And as they are important they could be falsified as well.
With this program you can verify the authenticity of a credit card introducing the number via command line.
The program will detect if you're using either a **American Express** ==AMEX== card, a **VISA** ==VISA== card or a **MasterCard** ==MC==. Otherwise it will tell you that the number may not be valid.
